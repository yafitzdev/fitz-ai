"""
Fitz Core - Paradigm-agnostic contracts for knowledge engines.

This module defines the stable abstractions that all engines must implement.
The core philosophy is: Knowledge → Engine → Answer.

Public API:
    - KnowledgeEngine: Protocol that all engines implement
    - Query: Input to engines
    - Answer: Output from engines
    - Provenance: Source attribution
    - Constraints: Query-time constraints
    - FitzPaths: Central path management
    - Exceptions: Standard error hierarchy

Examples:
    Using the core abstractions:
    >>> from fitz.core import Query, Constraints
    >>> from fitz.engines.classic_rag import ClassicRagEngine
    >>>
    >>> # Create an engine (engine-specific)
    >>> engine = ClassicRagEngine(config)
    >>>
    >>> # Use core abstractions (paradigm-agnostic)
    >>> query = Query(
    ...     text="What is quantum computing?",
    ...     constraints=Constraints(max_sources=5)
    ... )
    >>> answer = engine.answer(query)
    >>>
    >>> # Access results (paradigm-agnostic)
    >>> print(answer.text)
    >>> for source in answer.provenance:
    ...     print(f"Source: {source.source_id}")

    Using FitzPaths:
    >>> from fitz.core import FitzPaths
    >>> config_path = FitzPaths.config()
    >>> vector_db_path = FitzPaths.vector_db()
