"""
Context builder system for chunk enrichment.

Context builders extract structural information from files to provide
rich context for LLM-based summary generation. Each builder handles
specific file types and extracts relevant metadata (imports, exports,
headings, etc.).

Plugins are auto-discovered from the plugins/ directory.
