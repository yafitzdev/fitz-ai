"""
Recursive character text splitter.

The gold standard for "simple but good" chunking:
1. Try to split on paragraphs (\n\n)
2. If chunks still too big, split on lines (\n)
3. If still too big, split on sentences (. )
4. If still too big, split on words ( )
5. Last resort: split on characters

This preserves natural text boundaries while guaranteeing chunk size limits.
