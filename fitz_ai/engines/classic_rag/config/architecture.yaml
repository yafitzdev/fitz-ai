# Internal architecture mapping for Fitz.
#
# This file maps Python package prefixes to abstract architectural roles.
# It is the ONLY place that needs updating when the project structure changes.
#
# Roles themselves are defined in:
#   fitz_ai/core/_contracts/roles.py
#
# This file is intentionally not user-facing.
