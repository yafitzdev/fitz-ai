# fitz_ai/ingest/diff/__init__.py
"""
Incremental (diff) ingestion for Fitz.

This package implements content-hash AND config-aware incremental ingestion:
- Only ingest files that have changed content
- Re-ingest files when chunking/parsing/embedding config changes
- Track deletions via state file

Key components:
- Scanner: Walks directories and computes content hashes
- Differ: Computes action plan by checking state AND config
- Executor: Orchestrates the full pipeline with ChunkingRouter

Usage:
    from fitz_ai.ingest.diff import run_diff_ingest
    from fitz_ai.ingest.state import IngestStateManager
    from fitz_ai.ingest.chunking import ChunkingRouter

    router = ChunkingRouter.from_config(config)

    summary = run_diff_ingest(
        source="./documents",
        state_manager=IngestStateManager(),
        vector_db_writer=writer,
        embedder=embedder,
        parser=parser,
        chunking_router=router,
        collection="my_docs",
        embedding_id="cohere:embed-english-v3.0",
    )
    print(summary)
