Generate {num_hypotheses} different hypothetical document passages that would directly answer or contain relevant information for this query.

Question: {query}

Requirements for each passage:
1. Write as if you are the author of a REAL document (not meta-descriptions like "This document explains...")
2. Each passage should come from a DIFFERENT type of source document:
   - Financial/quarterly reports with specific numbers
   - Press releases or announcements
   - Internal project documentation
   - Technical specifications or research notes
   - Product catalogs or marketing materials
3. Include SPECIFIC concrete details: project names, dollar amounts, percentages, product names, facility names, team sizes, etc.
4. Use terminology and phrases that would actually appear in real corporate or technical documents

For abstract queries (strategy, approach, philosophy), imagine what documents would discuss the concrete IMPLEMENTATIONS of that concept - R&D spending, specific projects, facilities, initiatives, etc.

Return ONLY a JSON array of {num_hypotheses} passage strings, each 2-3 sentences with specific details.
Example: ["Our Q1 R&D investment of $150M funded three key initiatives...", "The Gigafactory expansion project represents our commitment to...", "Project Alpha team's research into next-gen battery cells..."]
