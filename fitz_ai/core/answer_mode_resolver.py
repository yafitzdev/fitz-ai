"""
Answer Mode Resolver - Maps constraint signals to epistemic posture.

This is a single, deterministic function that decides how certain
the answer should sound based on constraint results.

Rules (in priority order):
1. If any constraint signals "abstain" → ABSTAIN
2. If any constraint signals "disputed" → DISPUTED
3. If any constraint denied (without specific signal) → QUALIFIED
4. Otherwise → CONFIDENT
